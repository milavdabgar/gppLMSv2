function wise it should work. but class borrowed_book sounds odd. Can we use some other name or may be refactor totally the way library management system and its class work, like  bookrequest or transaction or account or any other. you may refactor database as far as you want.

for newer perspective. can you just try to completely refactor database model for library management system. 

just keep in mind that this lms is only going to be used for ebooks, but don't mention ebook, just use word book, keeping in mind further expansion.
