create apis and vue components for implementing the below features, use flask in backend and vue.js in frontend: 
1. member can request book for loan while browsing books, using book loan class
3. member can see a list of all the books he had taken on loans.
4. Members can return books taken on loan.
5. The librarian can get a list of all the book loan requets
6. The librarian can approve bookloan requests and issue books.
7. The librarian can see list of all the bookloans, and can filter by member and book
8. auto revoke book access after due date.

I'm providing few of the solutions, please brainstorm and comeup with the best and solution.
Desired output format:
Backend (Flask API)
Request Book for Loan:
	Endpoint: /api/bookloan/request
	Method: POST
	Payload: { "member_id": int, "book_id": int }
Frontend (Vue.js Components)
BookLoanRequestComponent:
	A form to request a book loan.
	Inputs: Book selection.
	Actions: Send POST request to /api/bookloan/request.

Services
BookService - Get book data
LoanService - Handle loan APIs
AuthService - User authentication
Router
Routes mapped to views
Navigation between views
Some key points:
Implement route-level components that call reusable child components. For example:
Loans.vue component loads LoanFilter and LoanList
LoanRequests.vue loads LoanRequestList and LoanRequestAction
Use services like BookService and MemberService to encapsulate API logic and handle pagination. Components call these services.

The Vue components could be organized into common UI elements like:
BaseListComponent - For displaying lists of data
BaseFilterComponent - For filter controls
BaseFormComponent - For forms like new loan request
BaseDialogComponent - For dialog popups like approval

Shared client-side services could encapsulate the API call logic, like:
BookLoanService
BookService
MemberService

Lean RESTful API focusing on resources
Reusable components promote consistency
Services encapsulate API logic
Views utilize components and services
Router handles navigation
