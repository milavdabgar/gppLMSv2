Library Management System v1 
It is a multi-user app (one required librarian and other general users/students)
- Used for issuing e-books to users
- User can request, read, return e-books
- Librarian can add new sections/e-books, issue/revoke access for a book.

Each Section may have: ID, Name, Date created, Description
Each book will have: ID, Name, Content, Author(s), Date issued, Return date.
Every section can have a number of books.
System will automatically show recently added sections/books or based on certain rating
Base requirements:Librarianâ€™s Dashboard, General User Profile, Section Management, Book Management, Search functionality for section/e-books

General User functionalities: 
- Login/Register
- View all the existing Sections/e-books
- Request/Return Books (content)
- A user can request for a maximum of 5 e-books 
- A user can access a book for a specific period of time (say N hours/days/weeks).For e.g. if N = 7 days, user can return a book before 7 days. If he/she fails to do so, the access for that will be automatically revoked after 7 days.
- User can give feedback for an e-book

Librarian functionalities
- Issue one or multiple e-book(s) to a user
- Revoke access for one or multiple e-book(s) from a user. Storage should handle multiple languages - usually UTF-8 encoding is sufficient for this
- Edit an existing section/e-book. Change content, author name,  no. of pages/volume etc.
- Remove an existing section/e-book
- Assign a book to a particular section
- A librarian can monitor current status of each e-book and the user it is issued to
- Available e-books in the Library

Search for e-books/sections
- Ability to search for a particular section.
- Ability to search e-books based on section, author etc

Download e-books as PDF for a price 
- APIs for interaction with sections and books. CRUD on e-books, Additional APIs for getting the creating graphs for librarian dashboard
- Validation:All form inputs fields - text, numbers, dates etc. with suitable messages.Backend validation before storing / selecting from database

# Library Management System v2

## Project Requirements

Here's a structured project guideline for the Library Management System:

1. User Authentication and Authorization
   - Implement user registration and login functionality using Flask Security or JWT-based token authentication
   - Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to differentiate between librarian and general users
   - Only one librarian account should exist in the system

2. General User Functionalities
   - View all existing sections and e-books
   - Request and return e-books (maximum of 5 e-books per user)
   - Access e-books for a specific period (e.g., 7 days) with automatic revocation after the period ends

   - Edit existing sections and e-books (content, author name, pages/volume, etc.)
   - Remove sections and e-books
   - Assign books to sections
   - Monitor the current status of each e-book and the user it is issued to
   - View available e-books in the library

4. Search Functionality
   - Implement search functionality for sections and e-books based on section, author, etc.

5. Backend Jobs
   - Implement export, reporting, and alert jobs
   - Daily Reminder Job: Check if users have visited the app and send alerts via Google Chat webhook, SMS, or email
   - Monthly Activity Report Job: Generate a monthly progress report in HTML or PDF format and send it to users via email

6. Backend Performance
   - Optimize backend performance for efficient handling of requests and data processing

7. Core Features
